```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
#


```{r cars}
library(here)
source(here("scripts", "Script_ggplot_10.09.25.R"))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
source(here("scripts", "Script_ggplot_10.09.25.R"))

plot1
```


```{r}

```


```{r include=FALSE}

```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
